### Project Overview

 Its a complex number calculator which takes input as real and imaginary numbers which can calculate addition,subtraction,division,multiplication which realtes to arithmatic operation and some more addons operations such as absolute,argument and conjugate. 


### Learnings from the project

 While completing this project (hackathon) i learn to create a class with multiple fuctions which performs the operation which being defined in the class and the class which being developed can be used to solve complex calculation of an real and imaginary nuumbers.
